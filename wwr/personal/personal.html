          <p id="paragraph-1">
             DirectSHED is a storage unit in Rexburg, Idaho built specifically for college students (though anybody is welcome to rent a unit) who live far from home and can’t bring all of their stuff home in between semesters. DISCLAIMER: DirectSHED is not a real business and none of the locations, numbers, prices, images, etc. are accurate depictions of these non-existent storage units.

          <h2 class="headlines" id="headline-2">Why DirectSHED?</h2>
          <p id="paragraph-2">
            DirectSHED is a high quality and cheaper alternative to the other storage units in Rexburg. Our storage units are more convenient than other units around town because of our close proximity to the BYU-I campus, our cheap, easy rentals, and our competitive price match system to other units close by. Our storage units also include a 24/7 security camera system for each individual unit to ensure your stuff’s safety!
          </p>
          <h2 class="headlines" id="headline-3">Our Philosophy</h2>
          <p id="paragraph-3">
            Here at DirectSHED, we believe in giving our customers the highest quality and cheapest option for a storage unit as possible! We understand the college struggle, and we want to help in the best way we know how: good units for low prices. Don’t miss out, we sell out quick at the start of each BYU-I semester!
