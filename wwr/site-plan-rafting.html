    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>

    <p>what do you usually do when you free?<br>
    Here is something that you will like, also if you are a big fan of outdoor you will love it. <br><br><br>
   This website is make for those people who love outdoor, and also for the people that don't know about it. You can see many pretty picture, so it will give you some ideas that what you will see if the nautre. <br><br>
   What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?<br>
   Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company by the river, or explore around camp while your guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven brownies. After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to talk your guide into another story or two to send you off to bed under more stars than you thought were possible.<br><br>
   I don't many people have question that is the rafting safe, or can they still go even know they don't know how to swim. <br>
   As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, we have guides that are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.<br><br>
   So what are you waitting for? Come and check out our page, join us and have fun with your friends for family.
