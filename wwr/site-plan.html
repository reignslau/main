      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose for the main page is to help people to find the right page that they want. And the I think with the home page they can have some ideas that what is the webside for, and have some image to help them have more ideas about the activity that we have. This webside is to show all the audiences that what are some outdoor thing that we have with some nice image. Also I think they can see the image that's in the home page and they will imagine they are there, and what they can do in the field. So they will have very high interest about it, and they can check the social media and they can see how other people think about it, then they can apply it. In the page they can see all the activity we have such as camping and rapids, also they will know that they will see many thing, more than just the thrill, but river and more. That's more close to the nature, and have fun with their friends or family. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This is for everyone that have interest to get more close to the nature, but underage people must have at least one adult be with them to join. </p>  <!-- change this -->
